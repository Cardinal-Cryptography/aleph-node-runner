# Aleph Node Runner

A convenience wrapper for running a node, using the Aleph Node docker image under the hood.

## Prerequisites

You will need `docker` and `wget`. If you are using Linux, we recommend that you add your user to the `docker` group so that using `docker` doesnâ€™t require sudo access. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

Clone the repo at https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/aleph-node-runner:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/aleph-node](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/aleph-node-runner)
cd aleph-node-runner
```

## Setup and running

Once inside the `aleph-node-runner` folder, run:

```bash
./run_node.sh --name <your_nodes_name>
```

It might take quite some time before you actually get the node running: the script will first download required files, including a database snapshot (sized ~100GB). It will then run the node for you and you should start seeing some block-related output.

> ðŸ’¡ The choice of <code>your_nodes_name</code> is entirely up to you but for the sake of more comprehensible logs please try using something unique and memorable.

## Running as an archivist

The default is to run the node as a validator. Should you choose to run as an archivist instead, you need to supply the `--archivist` flag:

```bash
./run_node.sh --archivist --name <your_nodes_name>
```

> ðŸ’¡ To run as an archivist, you will need additional network config [TODO].
